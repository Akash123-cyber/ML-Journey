    "# 📊 Scikit-learn Preloaded Datasets Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn (`sklearn.datasets`) comes with several **preloaded datasets** for quick experimentation and learning.  \n",
    "Below is a detailed table showing their **type**, **usage**, **description**, and whether they are **synthetic** or **real-world**.\n",
    "\n",
    "| 🧩 Dataset | 🧠 Type | 📈 Suitable For | 🧾 Description | 🌍 Data Origin |\n",
    "|-------------|----------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n",
    "| **Iris** | Multiclass Classification | Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM | Classify iris flowers into 3 species based on petal/sepal measurements. | 🌍 Real-world |\n",
    "| **Wine** | Multiclass Classification | Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM | Predict the origin of wines using chemical composition attributes. | 🌍 Real-world |\n",
    "| **Breast Cancer (Wisconsin)** | Binary Classification | Logistic Regression, Decision Trees | Detect whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on cell nucleus features. | 🌍 Real-world |\n",
    "| **Digits** | Multiclass Classification | Logistic Regression, Neural Nets | Handwritten digits (0–9) represented as 8×8 grayscale images. | 🌍 Real-world |\n",
    "| **Diabetes** | Regression | Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso | Predict a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline. | 🌍 Real-world |\n",

    "### 🧠 Tips:\n",
    "- ✅ Use **Real-world datasets** for *performance evaluation* and understanding generalization.  \n",
    "- ⚙️ Use **Synthetic datasets** for *concept testing*, *visualization*, and *algorithm understanding*.  \n",
    "- 🧩 All real-world datasets can be loaded using:  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "  from sklearn.datasets import load_iris, load_wine, load_breast_cancer\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 🧪 Synthetic datasets can be used dynamically\n",
