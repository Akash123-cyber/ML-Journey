    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In Machine Learning, the objective of a model is to **generalize well** to unseen data.\n",
    "Prediction error arises due to three main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bias\n",
    "- Variance\n",
    "- Irreducible Noise\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Bias–Variance Trade-Off** explains why increasing model complexity does not always improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "> **Bias** is a source of error introduced by making **simplifying assumptions** about the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A high-bias model:\n",
    "- Assumes the relationship is very simple\n",
    "- Fails to capture the true underlying pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics\n",
    "- High training error\n",
    "- High testing error\n",
    "- Model is rigid and inflexible\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "Using **simple linear regression** for a non-linear dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outcome\n",
    "➡️ **Underfitting**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Clarification\n",
    "In the bias–variance trade-off, **variance does NOT mean spread of the data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "> **Variance = how much the model changes when the training data changes slightly**<br>\n",
    "> **Variance** is the source of error caused when the model being **highly sensitive to small changes in the training dataset**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A high-variance model:\n",
    "- Fits training data extremely well\n",
    "- Changes significantly if trained on a slightly different dataset\n",
    "- Learns noise as if it were signal\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics\n",
    "- Very low training error\n",
    "- High testing error\n",
    "- Highly flexible model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "High-degree polynomial regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outcome\n",
    "➡️ **Overfitting**\n",
    "> **High variance leads to overfitting because the model is too sensitive to small changes in training data and starts learning noise instead of the underlying pattern.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Two Meanings of Variance (Critical Concept)\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Statistical Variance (Data Variance)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Property of the **dataset**\n",
    "- Measures how spread-out the data values are\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Model Variance (ML Variance)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Property of the **model**\n",
    "- Measures how much the model predictions vary when trained on different datasets drawn from the same population\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 These two variances are **conceptually different**, even though they share the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Signal vs Noise Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Origin\n",
    "- Derived from **World War II radar detection systems**\n",
    "- Radar had to distinguish:\n",
    "  - Signal → enemy aircraft\n",
    "  - Noise → random interference\n",
    "\n",
    "### In Machine Learning\n",
    "- **Signal** → true underlying pattern in data\n",
    "- **Noise** → random fluctuations and measurement errors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Idea\n",
    "> High-variance models cannot distinguish between signal and noise and therefore learn both.\n",
    "\n",
    "This directly leads to **overfitting**.\n",
